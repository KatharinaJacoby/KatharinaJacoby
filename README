**Emergency Physician → Clinical Systems Engineer**

---
### 👩‍⚕️💻 About Me
I’m an **emergency physician** who builds **software and automation tools** to fix real-world clinical problems.
As a **Clinical Systems Engineer**, I work at the intersection of **medicine and technical implementation**, focusing on:
- **Small, auditable tools** (FastAPI, SQLite, scikit-learn) that fit seamlessly into clinical workflows.
- **Safety-first design**: Transparency, rollback paths, and **patient care as the top priority**.
- **Local-first**: No cloud dependencies or unnecessary data sharing.
- **Advice-only systems**: Augmenting (never replacing) clinical judgment.

> *"I don’t build AI for healthcare. I build tools for healthcare professionals—where it adds real value."*

### 🚀 Selected Projects
*Here are some of the tools I’ve built to address real clinical challenges:*
#### Advice-Only Pipeline with Local LLM & SPC Monitoring
*Python • scikit-learn • FastAPI • SQLite • MIMIC-IV*

**Problem:**
Emergency departments need **safe, transparent decision support**—not black-box automation or cloud dependencies.

**Solution:**
- **MLP/CatBoost models**: Trained via LogisticRegression → ReLU/MLP → CatBoost A/B testing for **calibrated suggestions** (threshold τ).
- **SPC Monitoring**: Shewhart/EWMA for performance tracking (**review prompts only**, no auto-actions).
- **Decoupled architecture**: Prediction pipeline + LLM assistant as **separate services** (FastAPI + SQLite).
- **Privacy**: No cloud, no stored data—**in-memory processing only**.

**Status:**
SPC monitoring complete; A/B testing next.
Core pipeline functional; EHR integration (FHIR/JSON) in progress.

#### Heilmittel Assistent / BVBChecker
**Local Rules App for Practices**
*Python/FastAPI → Windows .exe (PyInstaller)*

- Checks **Besonderer Verordnungsbedarf** eligibility via ICD-10/JSON rules.
- **Runs offline**, no data stored, ships with installer scripts.
- **Status**: Core engine done; pilot testing next.

#### Medical T5 Mini
**Debugging-Driven Fine-Tuning**
*Hugging Face T5-small • DataCollator • Beam Search*

- Solved **"True"-only bug** via systematic isolation (task prefixing, pipeline cleaning).
- **Lesson**: Debugging ML like a physician—**rule out causes one by one**.
- **Status**: [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kjacoby/debugging-journey-t5-fine-tuning-true-bug)

### 🧭 What Is a Clinical Systems Engineer?
A **Clinical Systems Engineer** is a **healthcare professional who**:
1. **Spots inefficiencies** in clinical workflows.
2. **Builds practical tools** (e.g., automation, dashboards).
3. **Debugs like a physician**—root cause first.
4. **Prioritizes safety and simplicity** over complexity.

**Why this term?**
- **"Clinical"** because I start with **real healthcare problems**.
- **"Systems"** because I focus on **entire workflows**, not just models or apps.
- **"Engineer"** because I **write code, design tools, and fix bugs**—not just theorize.

> *"Most healthcare tech is built by engineers who don’t understand clinics—or clinicians who don’t build. I do both."*

---
### 🎓 Teaching & Methodology
I teach **"Clinical Debugging"**—applying **medical problem-solving** to technical systems:
1. Start with the **problem**, not the tool.
2. **Diagnose bugs** like a clinician: Data? Model? Deployment?
3. **No black boxes**: If we can’t explain it, it’s not production-ready.
4. **Test safely**: Shadow deployments and A/B tests—like clinical trials.

**Workshops/Talks I Offer**:
- *"Debugging AI Systems from a Physician’s Perspective"*
- *"Building Healthcare Tools That Actually Work"*
- *"Local-First Automation: Why the Cloud Isn’t Always the Answer"*

### 🤝 Collaboration & Consulting
I’m interested in working with:
- **Non-profits/NGOs** on **low-cost, high-impact** tech for global health.
- **Healthcare startups** that want to design **tools with (not for) clinicians**.
- **Research groups** working on **reproducible, ethical automation** in medicine.

**Let’s talk if you’re working on:**
✅ Open-source healthcare automation
✅ Offline/local tools for low-resource settings
✅ Clinician-centered design and governance
