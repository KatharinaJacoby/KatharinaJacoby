**Emergency Physician ‚Üí ML/Software Builder (ethics‚Äëfirst, advice‚Äëonly)**

### üë©‚Äçüíª About Me

Emergency physician building ML/LLM software (clinician-engineer). I deliver small, local-first tools with audit trails (`FastAPI`, `SQLite`, `scikit-learn`) and value safety, bias awareness, and clear rollback paths more than cleverness.


### üõ†Ô∏è Skills

- **Languages:** Python ‚Ä¢ SQL ‚Ä¢ TypeScript ‚Ä¢ (learning) Rust, Go, R, Julia
- **ML/DS:** scikit-learn ‚Ä¢ model evaluation (MAE/RMSE/AUC) ‚Ä¢ feature engineering ‚Ä¢ Hugging Face (T5) ‚Ä¢ experiment hygiene (seeds, CV, metrics)
- **Backend/App:** FastAPI ‚Ä¢ REST ‚Ä¢ SQLite ‚Ä¢ local‚Äëfirst design ‚Ä¢ PyInstaller packaging (Windows)
- **LLM tooling:** Local models via Ollama ‚Ä¢ prompt/tool contracts ‚Ä¢ safety governors ‚Ä¢ logging/audit trails
- **Ops/Quality:** Reproducible notebooks ‚Ä¢ smoke tests ‚Ä¢ SPC (Shewhart/EWMA) monitoring ‚Ä¢ governance checklists


### üöÄ Selected Projects

_Most of my projects are private. Feel free to [contact me](mailto:k.jacoby@posteo.de) for collaborations or more information!_

- **ED Pipeline** ‚Äî Activated UI Gate + MLP/CatBoost with SPC  
  _Python notebooks ‚Ä¢ scikit-learn/PyTorch ‚Ä¢ FastAPI_  
  - MLPGate emits advice-only suggestions with calibrated thresholds.
  - Training: LogisticRegression ‚Üí MLP (ReLU, dropout), 5xCV; AUPRC/AUROC/ECE reporting; CatBoost for tabular A/B.
  - Monitoring: Shewhart/EWMA SPC replaces black-box AD; transparent review rules, no auto-actions.
  - Governance: JSONL audit logs, fixed interfaces/config guards, smoke/preflight tests.
  - Data: MIMIC-IV ED Demo (public, de‚Äëidentified).
  - **Status:** Labels in progress; SPC complete; A/B MLP vs CatBoost next.

- **ED Assistant** ‚Äî Advice‚ÄëOnly Workflow Helper  
  _FastAPI ‚Ä¢ SQLite ‚Ä¢ Local LLM (Ollama) ‚Ä¢ DB tools_  
  - Summarizes stays (triage, vitals, meds, diagnoses); local-only, emits JSONL audit logs.
  - Governed by explicit advice-only contract; SPC for monitoring.
  - **Status:** Core API/tools working; summary endpoint and tool-calling next.

- **BVBChecker** ‚Äî Local Rules App for Practices  
  _Python/FastAPI ‚Üí Windows .exe (PyInstaller)_  
  - Checks Besonderer Verordnungsbedarf eligibility from ICD-10 (+age/sex) via JSON/CSV rules.
  - Runs offline, no data stored, ships with docs and installer scripts.
  - **Status:** Core rule engine/UI/Windows build done; ready for pilot.

- **Medical T5 Mini** ‚Äî Debugging‚ÄëDriven Fine‚ÄëTuning  
  _Hugging Face T5-small ‚Ä¢ DataCollator ‚Ä¢ beam search_  
  - Solved ‚ÄúTrue-only‚Äù bug by isolating pipeline steps, task prefixing, and feature cleaning.
  - Scaled dataset, trained ~40 epochs, clean outputs on held prompts.


### üß≠ Values & Governance

- **Advice-only by design:** No autonomous clinical actions.
- **Local-first privacy:** Minimal data footprint.
- **Reproducible:** Fixed seeds, pinned dependencies, smoke tests.
- **Bias & risk awareness:** Limitations noted; SPC monitors drift; rollback plan.

### ü§ù What I‚Äôm Looking For

I‚Äôd love to connect with people working on non-profit, open-source projects, especially those interested in building local ML/AI models, support systems for NGOs, or open healthcare solutions.
